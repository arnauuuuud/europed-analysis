This project is meant to help analysing results given by Europed. It relies on reading Europed output (stored in text files or HDF5 files), in order to infer how different quantities evolve through the different outputs. <br />
It is separated for now in two parts: <br />
- `hoho` contains the main analysis codes
- `cartoon` contains the plotting function
